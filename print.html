<blockquote>
<p>This process is modelled after the approach taken by the Rust programming
language, see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs">Rust RFC repository</a> for more information. Also see
<a href="https://github.com/maidsafe/rfcs">maidsafe's RFC process</a> for another project into the crypto space.
Our approach is taken and adapted from these.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make more substantial changes to bee, we ask for these to go through a more
organized design process --- an <em>RFC</em> (request for comments) process. The goal
is to organize work between the different developers affiliated with the IOTA
Foundation, and the wider open source community. We want to vet the ideas early
on, get and give feedback, and only then start the implementation once the
biggest questions are taken care of.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-is-substantial-and-when-to-follow-this-process" id="what-is-substantial-and-when-to-follow-this-process">What is <em>substantial</em> and when to follow this process</a></h2>
<p>You need to follow this process if you intend to make <em>substantial</em> changes to
bee and any of its constituting subcrates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anything that constitutes a breaking change as understood in the context of <em>semantic versioning</em>.</li>
<li>Any semantic or syntactic change to the existing algorithms that is not a bug fix.</li>
<li>Any proposed additional functionality and feature.</li>
<li>Anything that reduces interoperability (e.g. changes to public interfaces,
the wire protocol or data serialisation.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some changes do not require an RFC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rephrasing, reorganizing, refactoring, or otherwise
&quot;changing shape does not change meaning&quot;.</li>
<li>Additions that strictly improve objective, numerical quality criteria
(warning removal, speedup, better platform coverage, more parallelism, trap
more errors, etc.)</li>
<li><em>Internal</em> additions, i.e. additions that are invisible to users of the public API, and which probably
will be only noticed by developers of bee.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you submit a pull request to implement a new feature without going through
the RFC process, it may be closed with a polite request to submit an RFC first.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-workflow-of-the-rfc-process" id="the-workflow-of-the-rfc-process">The workflow of the RFC process</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>With both Rust and maidsafe being significantly larger projects, not all the steps below
might be relevant to bee's RFC process (for example, at the moment there are no dedicated subteams). However, to instill good open source governance we attempt to follow this process already now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, to get a major feature added to bee, one must first get the RFC
merged into the RFC repository as a markdown file. At that point the RFC is
&quot;active&quot; and may be implemented with the goal of eventual inclusion into bee.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fork the RFC repository</li>
<li>Copy <code>0000-template.md</code> to <code>text/0000-my-feature/0000-my-feature.md</code> (where
&quot;my-feature&quot; is descriptive; don't assign an RFC number yet; extra documents
such as graphics or diagrams go into the new folder).</li>
<li>Fill in the RFC. Put care into the details: RFCs that do not present
convincing motivation, demonstrate lack of understanding of the design's
impact, or are disingenuous about the drawbacks or alternatives tend to be
poorly-received.</li>
<li>Submit a pull request. As a pull request the RFC will receive design feedback
from the larger community, and the author should be prepared to revise it in
response.</li>
<li>Each pull request will be labeled with the most relevant sub-team, which will
lead to its being triaged by that team in a future meeting and assigned to
a member of the subteam.</li>
<li>Build consensus and integrate feedback. RFCs that have broad support are much
more likely to make progress than those that don't receive any comments. Feel
free to reach out to the RFC assignee in particular to get help identifying
stakeholders and obstacles.</li>
<li>The sub-team will discuss the RFC pull request, as much as possible in the
comment thread of the pull request itself. Offline discussion will be
summarized on the pull request comment thread.</li>
<li>RFCs rarely go through this process unchanged, especially as alternatives and
drawbacks are shown. You can make edits, big and small, to the RFC to clarify
or change the design, but make changes as new commits to the pull request,
and leave a comment on the pull request explaining your changes.
Specifically, do not squash or rebase commits after they are visible on the
pull request.</li>
<li>At some point, a member of the subteam will propose a &quot;motion for final
comment period&quot; (FCP), along with a disposition for the RFC (merge, close, or
postpone).
<ul>
<li>This step is taken when enough of the tradeoffs have been discussed that
the subteam is in a position to make a decision. That does not require
consensus amongst all participants in the RFC thread (which is usually
impossible). However, the argument supporting the disposition on the RFC
needs to have already been clearly articulated, and there should not be
a strong consensus against that position outside of the subteam. Subteam
members use their best judgment in taking this step, and the FCP itself
ensures there is ample time and notification for stakeholders to push
back if it is made prematurely.</li>
<li>For RFCs with lengthy discussion, the motion to FCP is usually preceded
by a summary comment trying to lay out the current state of the
discussion and major tradeoffs/points of disagreement.</li>
<li>Before actually entering FCP, all members of the subteam must sign off;
this is often the point at which many subteam members first review the
RFC in full depth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The FCP lasts ten calendar days, so that it is open for at least 5 business
days. It is also advertised widely, e.g. on discord or in a blog post. This
way all stakeholders have a chance to lodge any final objections before
a decision is reached.</li>
<li>In most cases, the FCP period is quiet, and the RFC is either merged or
closed. However, sometimes substantial new arguments or ideas are raised, the
FCP is canceled, and the RFC goes back into development mode.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-rfc-life-cycle" id="the-rfc-life-cycle">The RFC life-cycle</a></h2>
<p>Once an RFC becomes active then authors may implement it and submit the feature
as a pull request to the repo. Being &quot;active&quot; is not a rubber stamp and in
particular still does not mean the feature will ultimately be merged. It does
mean that in principle all the major stakeholders have agreed to the feature
and are amenable to merging it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fact that a given RFC has been accepted and is &quot;active&quot;
implies nothing about what priority is assigned to its implementation, nor does
it imply anything about whether a developer has been assigned the task of
implementing the feature. While it is not necessary that the author of the RFC
also write the implementation, it is by far the most effective way to see an
RFC through to completion. Authors should not expect that other project
developers will take on responsibility for implementing their accepted feature.</p>
<p>Modifications to active RFCs can be done in follow up PRs. We strive to write
each RFC in a manner that it will reflect the final design of the feature,
however, the nature of the process means that we cannot expect every merged RFC
to actually reflect what the end result will be at the time of the next major
release. We therefore try to keep each RFC document somewhat in sync with the
network feature as planned, tracking such changes via followup pull requests to
the document.</p>
<p>An RFC that makes it through the entire process to implementation is considered
&quot;implemented&quot; and is moved to the &quot;implemented&quot; folder. An RFC that fails after
becoming active is &quot;rejected&quot; and moves to the &quot;rejected&quot; folder.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#reviewing-rfcs" id="reviewing-rfcs">Reviewing RFCs</a></h2>
<p>While the RFC pull request is up, the sub-team may schedule meetings with the
author and/or relevant stakeholders to discuss the issues in greater detail,
and in some cases the topic may be discussed at a sub-team meeting. In either
case a summary from the meeting will be posted back to the RFC pull request.</p>
<p>A sub-team makes final decisions about RFCs after the benefits and drawbacks
are well understood. These decisions can be made at any time, but the sub-team
will regularly issue decisions. When a decision is made, the RFC pull request
will either be merged or closed. In either case, if the reasoning is not clear
from the discussion in thread, the sub-team will add a comment describing the
rationale for the decision.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#implementing-an-rfc" id="implementing-an-rfc">Implementing an RFC</a></h2>
<p>Some accepted RFCs represent vital features that need to be implemented right
away. Other accepted RFCs can represent features that can wait until some
arbitrary developer feels like doing the work. Every accepted RFC has an
associated issue tracking its implementation in the affected repositories.
Therefore, the associated issue can be assigned a priority via the triage
process that the team uses for all issues in the appropriate repositories.</p>
<p>The author of an RFC is not obligated to implement it. Of course, the RFC
author (like any other developer) is welcome to post an implementation for
review after the RFC has been accepted.</p>
<p>If you are interested in working on the implementation for an &quot;active&quot; RFC, but
cannot determine if someone else is already working on it, feel free to ask
(e.g. by leaving a comment on the associated issue).</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#rfc-postponement" id="rfc-postponement">RFC postponement</a></h2>
<p>Some RFC pull requests are tagged with the &quot;postponed&quot; label when they are
closed (as part of the rejection process). An RFC closed with &quot;postponed&quot; is
marked as such because we want neither to think about evaluating the proposal
nor about implementing the described feature until some time in the future, and
we believe that we can afford to wait until then to do so. Historically,
&quot;postponed&quot; was used to postpone features until after 1.0. Postponed pull
requests may be re-opened when the time is right. We don't have any formal
process for that, you should ask members of the relevant sub-team.</p>
<p>Usually an RFC pull request marked as &quot;postponed&quot; has already passed an
informal first round of evaluation, namely the round of &quot;do we think we would
ever possibly consider making this change, as outlined in the RFC pull request,
or some semi-obvious variation of it.&quot; (When the answer to the latter question
is &quot;no&quot;, then the appropriate response is to close the RFC, not postpone it.)</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#help-this-is-all-too-informal" id="help-this-is-all-too-informal">Help! This is all too informal</a></h2>
<p>The process is intended to be as lightweight as reasonable for the present
circumstances. As usual, we are trying to let the process be driven by
consensus and community norms, not impose more structure than necessary.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h1>
<p>This RFC introduces a README for the Bee project, explaining that it will be
a framework written in Rust allowing to write nodes participating in the IOTA
network and tools interacting with it.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#motivation" id="motivation">Motivation</a></h1>
<p>In order to motivate our own work and explain to the community what we are doing,
it is crucial to have a good README.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#detailed-design" id="detailed-design">Detailed design</a></h1>
<p>The README is available at
<a href="https://github.com/SuperFluffy/bee-readme/blob/master/README.md"><code>SuperFluffy/bee-readme/README.md</code></a>
and reproduced below:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-iota-bee-framework" id="the-iota-bee-framework">The IOTA Bee framework</a></h1>
<p>Bee is a Rust framework to build IOTA nodes and tools that interact with the IOTA network. The final product is envisioned to be a highly modular collection of foundational crates that can be mixed and matched, and extended upon.</p>
<p>Bee may be seen as an effort to streamline the IOTA Foundation's different libraries into one fundamental collection of Rust crates. These will expose foreign function interfaces (FFIs) to be used in more high level languages, and form the basis for the next iteration of client APIs.</p>

</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#motivation-1" id="motivation-1">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>Our primary motivation is to make IOTA an exemplary open source project, with
great documentation, clear examples of increasing complexity, and well-tested
code. Entry into the IOTA developer ecosystem should be as straight forward as
possible, so that people can start contributing, extending, and building their
ideas on top of the IOTA network using the Bee framework. As such, we want to
be ready for development driven by our own dev and research teams, as well as
novel ideas coming out of our community.</p>
<p>Bee will provide one central reference implementation of the most important
data structures and algorithms, which will be verified and eventually
certified. By this approach, we hope that improvements in any core components
will quickly propagate to all other libraries building on them, rather than
having to fix each single implementation we encounter.</p>
<p>The IOTA Foundation aims to allow machines of all performance levels to
contribute to the IOTA network, from microcontrollers and single-board
computers, to phones, web browsers, desktop machines and servers. We therefore
want to implement Bee's constituent libraries from the ground up, to allow the
import of each library on its own, with each library having as few dependencies
as possible. Having microcontrollers in mind, we want these libraries to not
rely on a runtime — this includes language runtimes such as garbage
collection, but also OS integration (which, in the case of Rust, is provided by
its <code>libstd</code> standard library). </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#milestones" id="milestones">Milestones</a></h2>
<p>The Bee framework was primarily created to support the implementation of the
IOTA <a href="https://coordicide.iota.org/">Coordicide</a>. As previously stated, on the
path to Coordicide we aim to make this framework as open, vetted and usable as
possible, by supporting the creation of tools, clients, nodes…</p>
<p>Our proposed milestones are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fundamental crates</strong>: Specification and implementation of the Bee fundamental crates <code>bee-trinary</code>, <code>bee-model</code>, and <code>bee-crypto</code>. These are the essential bricks for IOTA development.</li>
<li><strong>FFI</strong>: Foreign Function Interface to make the Bee crates available to other languages. The first project relying on Bee crates through FFI will be Trinity v2.
<ul>
<li>We will also investigate in how far WebAssembly, <code>wasm</code>, might be an intermediate milestone.</li>

<li><strong>Rust IRI</strong>: Specification and implementation of the node-specific crates <code>bee-network</code>, <code>bee-tangle</code>, <code>bee-api</code>, <code>bee-consensus</code>, and <code>bee-gossip</code>. To demonstrate the modularity and robustness of the Bee framework, a node for the current mainnet will be implemented. Some of these crates will be repurposed for the Coordicide node.</li>
<li><strong>Coordicide</strong>: Specification and implementation of new Coordicide node-specific crates once research specifications are delivered.</li>

<h2><a class="header" href="#why-rust" id="why-rust">Why Rust?</a></h2>
<p>The IOTA Foundation aims to allow machines of all performance levels to
contribute to the IOTA network: from microcontrollers to phones and servers.
Some of these systems will have minimal resources and lack an operating system.
Microcontrollers aside, we also aim for energy efficiency, high performance,
and a great user and developer experience.</p>
<p>From the available choice of languages, we felt that Rust was the best fit.
Rust being a system programming language, it operates at a high level of
performance while providing strong memory safety guarantees. Together with its
well-integrated modern tooling, this helps us iterate on our designs faster
while being more confident that our code does what we intend it to do (without
accessing uninitialized memory, double free, use after free, null pointer
dereference, and buffer overflows that are all security concerns).</p>
